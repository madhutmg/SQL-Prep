# SQL Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is part of my personal SQL learning journey — something I’m building to showcase my growth as I progress from **basic to advanced levels** of SQL.

### 📘 Current Contents
This repository currently includes a **MySQL script** containing:

- Database creation and table setup  
- Sample data (for practice and testing queries)  
- 30 beginner-level SQL questions and their solutions  

These questions cover essential SQL fundamentals every beginner should master, such as:
- Creating and selecting databases  
- Using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY`  
- Filtering and sorting data  
- Applying aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)  
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  
- Writing subqueries and using aliases

### 🔜 What’s Next
This repository represents the **first step** of my SQL journey — I’ll keep adding new files as I move forward to:

- **Intermediate-level SQL:** advanced joins, nested subqueries, window functions, and CTEs  
- **Advanced-level SQL:** data analytics queries, performance optimization, and real-world case problems  

Each file will represent a new phase of my growth and learning.
